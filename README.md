# Giphy API

By: Michael Whitaker

This is a search engine used to download gifs from Giphy.com. Users can enter keywords
or phrases into the search bar, and an API will return gif images to display on the page.

Technologies used:
HTML,
SCSS,
JQuery,
JavaScript

Ideas for improvement:

Additional pages for content will be needed for the future, and possibly a download option
for search results.

User Stories:

1. As a website designer, I need a site to download new content so that I can style my pages better.
2. As a teacher, I need a easy way to access pictures and images so that I can engage my students.
